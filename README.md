# Identification of Frost in Martian HiRISE Images

## Overview
This project focuses on identifying frost in Martian HiRISE (High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment) images using deep learning techniques. It utilizes Keras and TensorFlow for model development, transfer-learning to enhance model performance, and Pandas for data preprocessing and analysis.

## Features
- **CNN + MLP Model**: Engineered a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for classification of Martian images into frost or terrain.
- **Transfer-Learning**: Leveraged transfer-learning with pre-trained models to expedite training and improve performance on the dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Utilized Pandas for preprocessing Martian image data to prepare it for model training.
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: Implemented using Keras and TensorFlow for model development and deployment.

## Technologies Used
- **Keras**: Deep learning framework used for building and training the CNN + MLP model.
- **TensorFlow**: Backend framework used with Keras for accelerated deep learning computations.
- **Transfer-Learning**: Technique used to apply knowledge learned from pre-trained models to enhance learning on new tasks.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation, cleaning, and preprocessing tasks.
